Hi Alek,

Do costs factor into who you choose as a phone service provider? If so, let me know. I'd be happy to quote you on a new phone system--even for curiosity's sake.

Think about this: DOTVOX provides businesses with multiple ways to reduce expenditures without cutting corners on service. In short, DOTVOX cuts costs with:

No PBX equipment – No hardware is needed to install, maintain, or upgrade.
No physical phones required – Software-based phones and a mobile app eliminates the need for physical phones if a company chooses
Flat Pricing – No charges per minute. No hidden costs. No nickel-and-diming
We’re proud to say most of our clients have switched over other providers because we simply cost less and offered more. While I know you might not be near the end of your contract, we can offer you a quote you can refer back to when the time comes.

Let me know if you’d like to get in contact this coming Monday at 1 pm over the phone. Thanks, Alek.
